# Financial-chatbot
This project was done under BCG job simulation.I recently participated in BCG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a GenAI Consulting team at BCG.
I worked on a project to develop an AI-powered financial chatbot. I practiced using Excel, Python, pandas, and other libraries and built my data analysis and NLP skills in a real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I enjoy working on translating complex financial data into accessible insights through AI, and I'm excited to apply these skills on a GenAI Consulting team at a company like BCG.
